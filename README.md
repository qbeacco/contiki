The Contiki Operating System
============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/contiki-os/contiki.svg?branch=release-3-0)](https://travis-ci.org/contiki-os/contiki/branches)

Contiki is an open source operating system that runs on tiny low-power
microcontrollers and makes it possible to develop applications that
make efficient use of the hardware while providing standardized
low-power wireless communication for a range of hardware platforms.

Contiki is used in numerous commercial and non-commercial systems,
such as city sound monitoring, street lights, networked electrical
power meters, industrial monitoring, radiation monitoring,
construction site monitoring, alarm systems, remote house monitoring,
and so on.
